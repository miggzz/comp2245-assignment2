                <h2>Cherry Pie</h2>

                   Whoever said you can’t make a good cherry pie with sweet cherries was lying. Sure, I love a sour or tart cherry pie as much as the next cherry-lover, but when the Greenmarket only has the sweet ones, there’s no reason to run in the other direction.

                <p>
                    It helps that they were early-season cherries, thus not as sweet as the dark purple Bings we’re getting in the supermarkets right now. But I maintain that even if their sugars were fully developed, you could have just dialed back the sugar and punched up the acidity some more to balance it out.

                <h2>White Chicken Chili</h2>
                <p class="post-info"> 2023 COOKING CLASSY</p>
                <img src="https://www.cookingclassy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/white-chicken-chili-1-768x1152.jpg" class="blog-image">
                <p>Flavorful White Chicken Chili made with hearty beans, tender chicken, and a rich and creamy broth. It’s a great alternative to traditional beef chili and makes for a super satisfying dinner! If you’re lucky to have any left it will make great leftovers for lunch the next day too!
                    
                </p>
                <p>
                   This is a recipe you’ll want to be making year round, even as it starts to get warm outside. It’s probably different than what you’d expect with the label of “chili” in the title but it is amazingly delicious!
